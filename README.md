# Data_Wrangling_Project
This project covers the three stages of the data wrangling process.
I gathered 3 different file formats of data from 3 different sources. 
* twiiter_archived_enhanced.csv which was already provided; just had to download and read into a dataframe -
* imagepredictions.tsv(the tweet image prediction) which was gotten from its url using Requests method
* tweet-json.txt- which was gotten alternatively from the notebook as i have not been granted access to twitter api yet then read into a data frame(dog_count_list).
